Hello, AS-Users,

OK, here it is, the C-Version of AS that is theoretically compilable
on any system that has an ANSI-C-compiler!  Compared to the original
Pascal version (I will furtherly call it the 'BP version'), speed is
a bit lower due to the way C handles strings and the presence of a lot
of 16-bit-integers, but that's so far the price of portability...

This version is still very, very beta!  Use on your own risk!

This file is only for the purpose of getting AS compiled and installed,
and lists the differences of the C version to the BP version.  It 
is not meant to be the user's manual for AS.  Unfortunately, this manual
currently only exists in german language (see the doc_DE directory); first
attempts of a translation to english are located in the doc_EN dirtectory.

LICENSING

Those who have already used the original DOS/Pascal version of AS
will know that AS is completely free: you may use and modify AS for
whatever purpose you like (regardless whether it is commercial or
not), given that you do not remove my copyright from the sources and
that programs that build upon the AS sources are given out under the
same license terms.  Of course, if you add something significant,
you may also add your own name to the copyright list!

To make things a bit more interesting (for me), I have added a detail
to the license terms of the C version: it is wineware!  If you want
and have time, you may send me a bottle of your favourite wine...


PLATFORMS

So far, I have tested this version of AS on the following machines:

- Digital Unix 3.2 with DEC-C
- Ultrix 4.3 with gcc 2.7.2
- Linux/Alpha with gcc 2.7.0
- Linux/Intel with gcc 2.7.2
- NetBSD/Sun3 with gcc 2.7.2
- SunOS 4.1.3/Sparc with gcc 2.6.3
- Solaris 2.5/Sparc with Sun-C 3.0.1
- SGI Irix 5.3/6.2 with SGI-C
- HP9000/7xx HP-UX 9.0 with HP-C
- NetBSD/pmax with gcc 2.7.2

However, compilation should work on virtually any UNIX system with an
ANSI-compliant compiler that can handle signed and unsigned integers
of 1, 2, 4, and optionally 8 bytes length.  'cc' delivered with
SunOS or Ultrix do NOT fall into this category!  Use 'gcc' resp.
'c89' on these systems!

For the future, I am planning to use this version also on non-UNIX
systems like OS/2 Warp with emx/gcc.


DIFFERENCES / THINGS TO DO

The portable C version of AS has the following, known differences to
the original BP version:

- Floating point values are internally only stored as IEEE double 
  precision values, not in the 80-bit format Intel NPUs use. 
  Therefore, floating point ranges and accuracy are not as good as in
  the BP version.  Currently, there seems to be no portable,
  standardized 128-bit-format for FP numbers.  Every vendor (IBM,
  SUN, CRAY, SGI...) uses his own format, so supporting them all
  looks like a lot of work...

- On most systems, integer arithmetic is done with 64-bit-numbers. 
  This should hurt only programs that explicitly exploit overflow
  and sign effects on 32-bit-versions of AS.

- Only a part of the processor families supported by the BP version
  have so far been ported and tested.  The subset is constantly
  growing, but it takes quite a long time to port them in a tidy
  fashion...  I tried to port/test the most popular parts first;
  the order of porting and addition of new families is driven by
  request/needs!

  Currently, the following families have been ported and tested:

  - Motorola 680x0
  - Motorola DSP56K
  - PowerPC 
  - Motorola 68xx,6804,6805,68HC08,6809,68HC12,68HC16
  - Hitachi H8/300(H/L)
  - Hitachi H8/500
  - Hitachi SH7x00
  - 65xx/MELPS-740
  - 65816/MELPS77xx
  - Mitsubishi MELPS-4500
  - Mitsubishi M16C
  - Intel MCS/48
  - Intel MCS/(2)51
  - Intel MCS/(1)96
  - Intel 8080/8085
  - Intel 8086/NEC V30/V35
  - Philips XA
  - Atmel AVR
  - AMD 29K
  - Siemens 80C166/167
  - Zilog Zx80
  - Zilog Z8
  - Toshiba TLCS-900
  - Toshiba TLCS-90
  - Toshiba TLCS-870
  - Toshiba TLCS-47(0(A))
  - Toshiba TLCS-9000
  - Microchip PIC 16C5x
  - Microchip PIC 16C8x
  - Microchip PIC 17C4x
  - SGS/Thomson ST6
  - Texas TMS3201x
  - Texas TMS320C2x
  - Texas TMS320C3x
  - Texas TMS320C5x
  - Texas TMS370
  - Texas MSP430
  - NEC uPD78C1x
  - NEC 75K0
  - NEC 78K0
  - National Semi COP8

  The following families are supported in alpha state, i.e. their code
  generator went through the compiler, but I haven't assembled anything
  with them so far.  Using them might erect errors ranging from amusing
  to fatal...please be patient, I'm trying to dig out the test files
  again, or make a try on your own...

  - Mitsubishi M16

  The following families still have to be implemented, in their probable
  order of appearance:

  <currently none, but may change again...>

- NLS is in its infant state.  I included code to use the langinfo
  functions, but I don't get anything else but the C locale so far
  :-(

- most UNIX systems name their own assembler already 'as', so I had
  to modify the name to 'asl'.  The additional letter is to the honor
  of a person that did quite a lot to spread the UNIX philosophy ;-)

- the C version was designed to have exactly the same command line
  interface as the original BP version; however, UNIX shells
  interprete some special characters like the dollar sign for hex
  values in their own way, so you might have to work with escape (\)
  and quote characters.

- the USEXMS resp. USEEMS and ASXSWAP environment variables do not
  exist (thankfully).

- the undocumented C-style preprocessor doesn't work yet.


INSTALLATION

First, you need a file 'Makefile.def' that defines some settings for
your local system.  I deliberatly didn't use GNU autoconfig because I
want to port this program also to non-UNIX-platforms, maybe even back
to MS-DOS to replace the original BP version...

'Makefile.def.tmpl' contains sample settings.  Copy this file to
'Makefile.def' and change what you need to change (e.g. if you want
to place the binaries and include files in different directories). I
also included some 'Makefile.def'-files that have been tested in the
'Makefile.def-samples' directory.  You might still want to look into
these files, as they contain some optinal settings.

Second, type 'make' and compilation should start.  If you get an
error in file 'sysdefs.h' saying that your system is unknown, you
have to extend this file (and send the extension back to me!).  The
settings made in this file define which integer types have which
length (AS really needs to know this, as it generates files that
shall be binary portable!!) and whether the system has NLS.  The
#ifdef's in this file are structured in the following way:

1. processor type
  2. system name
    3. OS name

If you get warnings about ANSI C not supporting 'long long'
variables, ignore them.  This is the only wanted deviation from ANSI
C!  If you are on a Solaris machine with Sun's C compiler and get
tons of 'Semantics of ... change ...' warnings , you may also ignore
them; they just mean that the old SunOS compiler would have handled
things differently.  Any other warnings/errors are worth notifying me
of.

Third, do a 'make test'.  This will assemble some test programs with
the version of AS you have just compiled and compare the results to
reference binaries.  It might be a good idea to pipe this command's
output through a 'tee' since the output is quite lengthy and you
might overlook some messages otherwise.  Any failed test is worth
looking into!.
Some of the test programs will generate warnings from AS.  This is
normal and not an indication of a wrong configuration!  I included
a list of warnings that have to occur.  The files are in the tests/
directory and are named warnlog_xxx, where xxx is the
abbreviation for the selected language.

Fourth, install everything with 'make install'.  This will place the
binaries and processor include files in the directores you specified
in 'Makefile.def' .


BENCHMARKS

And now a section for the 'mine is bigger than yours'-guys, a table
with some benchmark results for the test applications.  The times are
the wallclock times AS prints itself, measured three times, averaged
and rounded to 1/100's of seconds.  As system overhead goes into these
times, memory size and disk speed play a role, so do not quarrel if
the results you get vary by a few percent...when measuring, assure
that your machine is otherwise unloaded and all the files are on a
local filesystem!  Speed of screen output is also an issue, so it may
not be a bright idea to do the tests on a Sparc console in single user
mode...

Optimization is the highest available, with some CPU-specific optimi-
zations (e.g. -m486) ...

Note for the 486's: To avoid confusion, I named the 486 CPU's according
to the factor they physically use in multiplying the external clock.
E.g., an AM486DX4/100 which physically triples the clock is named 
AM486DX3, and an AM5x86 which physically quadruples the clock is named 
AM486DX4!

Notes:

(1) ECOFF-based
(2) Program did not work with -O3, -O2 chosen
(3) a.out-based
(4) node program, very slow I/O!
(5) half of memory is slow 16bit/7.16MHz
(6) slower  (100ns) memory
(7) best performance achieved with optimization level 1 ?!

The index numbers at the end of the lines can be calculated with the following
HP28 program:

<< 359.52 SWAP / ROT 65.12 SWAP / ROT 33.52 SWAP / + + 3 / >>

whereby the last value is the second last divided by the clock frequency.

Non-UPN-wheenies may also compile the 'marks' C program in this distribution.

You have to find out the rest for yourself ;-)

I calculated this weighed ratio to get a uniqe number to sort the list; there
is so far no special name for this measure.  Call them ASstones, ASmarks, SPECas
or whatever you like ;-)
